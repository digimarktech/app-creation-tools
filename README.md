## Development Tools

- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) - Xcode is the primary IDE (integrated development environment) used to create apps for the apple ecosystem. This includes iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Xcode is created and maintained by Apple and is free in the mac app store.

- [Mac Computer](https://www.apple.com/mac/) - In order to develop for the apple ecosystem, it requires that you have a mac computer of some sort. This can range from iMac, Macbook, Macbook mini etc. If you do not have a mac, there is a service called [macincloud](https://www.macincloud.com) that allows you to rent a virtual mac in the cloud. This is a shortcut to developing apple apps on a pc.

- [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac) - A [git](https://git-scm.com) client that allows you to manage your repository.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) - A free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
